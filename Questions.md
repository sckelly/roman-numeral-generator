# Please give an example of a software component you have designed and written from concept to deployment, outlining the steps you have took.

Using concourse and Continuous Integration, I have helped to build a Monitoring and Tracking application for Glasgow City Council. My team and I have worked on creating an interactive, user focussed web application that will allow teachers from schools across Glasgow to monitor their pupils throughout their time at school. By engaging with a small group of teachers in the Glasgow area, I have helped to gather requirements for the projects scope, focussing on what teachers in both primary and secondary schools would find useful. Aiming to build an intuitive application, using Agile SCRUM, we split the work components into relevant sprints, allowing for a demo to the client every two weeks, where we show the work that we have done in accordance with the Acceptance Criteria that the client has agreed too. The project has some very interesting challenges, it will used on iPads and so we have focussed on mobile first, as well as adding interesting UI features such as drag and drop.

In the M&T app, the main cornerstone of all activies are Tracking periods, which could also be referred to as term times. Tracking periods allow teachers to monitor pupils academic success against various subjects, as well as extra curricular activies that they do (Rugby). During a recent sprint I was put in charge of creating a Tracking period manager that would allow the displaying of TPs as a bar across months, as well as the editing of these TPs. As the design of the calendar was unique in that it was not to show dates as strict entities, there was a challenge in approximating where a Tracking period would start and end in each month. As such I had created the calendar to have each month as a block which would display TPs as a bar within the block. I first set out each month, with a start and end date, then I used a JS library, Luxon, which has a Duration object to determine whether a TP fell within or outwith a month. By determining the date difference and using ES6's Math.sign() I could tell where a TP would lie in regards to each month. 

# Using the example that you provided above tell us about how you ensured your software was fit for purpose and of high quality. What did you learn and what would you do differently next time to do a better job?

<!-- To ensure that the Tracking Period calendar was fit for purpose I used TDD and . I first thought of the problem scope as a programming flow, as opposed to diving straight into the problem and coding myself in a knot. By using Luxon's Duration objects to tell the difference between TP dates and the Months dates, I came up with some assertions of what to look for in a given case. I knew for example that if a TP began in August and ended in October, the difference (Luxon Duration object) between the TP start and end dates from the months start and end dates would give certain positive and negative values. From the assertions gathered, I could determine that the TP bar should take the whole month. By working out these assertions before coding or testing, I could ensure my tests were written thoroughly and accurately. Learning from the experience I realise the algorithm I used could have been more elegant, and to do a better job in future I would try to take more time to think, and compare my thoughts and assertions with teammates. -->
